## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

I first discovered coding through a **Girl Scouts workshop in middle school**, and it was love at first line of code.  
Since then, I’ve blended my artistic side with my technical background — crafting experiences that are as beautiful as they are functional.

**Currently Learning:**  
Exploring **JavaScript libraries** and **CSS frameworks** to enhance my workflow and streamline front-end development.

**Outside of Tech:**  
When I’m not coding, I’m creating art. I’m an **oil pastel artist** inspired by **surrealism** and love finding creative ways to merge art and technology.
